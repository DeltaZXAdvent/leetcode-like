// TODO Not finished
// * Solution
// Every two positions have a distance. And there is a distance formula.
// Discuss when the difference (m, n) satisifies m mod 3 = i, n mod 3 = j,
// where i = 0, 1, 2, j = 0, 1, 2.
// The boundaries affect the result.
//
// Loop for every position. Maybe there can be some branch and cut.
