// Description:
// calculate the size of the largest lan limited to the left-upper area for every server
// and record their starting points (that is, the most left-upper server)
// when there are both an upper and a left server, join the starting points
// in the end, based on sizes of all the network, decide which is the largest
// Maybe some optimization can be done. But not that great in this problem.
