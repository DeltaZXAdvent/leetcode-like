// TODO unfinished
// * Analogous specification
// There is a circle, there are three categories of points on it.
// Find the longest arc which contains even numbers of points of each category.
// * Solution
// To change the oddity of the number of points of each category,
// we can gradually decrement the arc length.
// The oddity of the full arc is determined.
//
// Let's not dicuss then.
